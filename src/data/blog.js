## Quick answer
Flooring costs in Edmonton usually depend on **material + prep + installation**. A “cheap” product can become expensive if the subfloor needs work, stairs are involved, or you want premium trims and transitions.

Below are **practical ranges** to help you budget with fewer surprises.

---

## What affects the final price the most
**1) Subfloor prep**
- Leveling compound, patching, moisture mitigation, squeak fixes
- This can be the difference between a smooth install and ongoing issues later

**2) Room shape + stairs**
- More cuts = more labor
- Stairs are typically priced separately because they’re detail-heavy

**3) Removing old flooring**
- Carpet, glue-down, tile removal, and disposal add time and dump fees

**4) Finishing details**
- Baseboards, shoe molding, transitions, stair noses, reducers
- These often get missed in “quick quotes”

---

## Typical Edmonton price ranges (material + installation)
These are ballpark ranges to help you plan. Your home’s condition can move the number up or down.

### Luxury Vinyl Plank (LVP)
**Best for:** basements, busy homes, rentals  
**Typical range:** mid budget, strong durability  
What changes cost:
- Core type (SPC/WPC), wear layer, underlay, stair nosing

### Laminate
**Best for:** dry areas, great visuals for the price  
What changes cost:
- Water resistance rating, thickness, underlay choice

### Engineered Hardwood / Hardwood
**Best for:** premium feel, resale value  
What changes cost:
- Species, plank width, installation method, acclimation, stairs

### Tile
**Best for:** bathrooms, entries, commercial wear zones  
What changes cost:
- Large format tile, waterproofing, uncoupling membrane, grout type

> Want a fast estimate? Measure your square footage and list: flooring type, stairs (yes/no), and whether the floor is currently level.

## Hidden costs people forget (and how to plan)
**Underlay & moisture barriers**  
Not always included. Basements often need extra moisture protection.

**Trim + baseboards**  
Replacing baseboards looks cleaner than reinstalling old ones.

**Transitions**  
Doorways and mixed flooring areas need the right transitions for a safe, finished look.

**Furniture moving**  
Some installs include it, some don’t. Clarify up front.

## How to get a quote that matches the final invoice
Use this checklist when you request pricing:

- Total square feet (approx is fine)
- Flooring type (LVP, laminate, hardwood, tile)
- Basement or above grade?
- Stairs? How many?
- Existing flooring to remove?
- Any dips/uneven spots?
- Timeline and access (occupied home, pets, etc.)

The more details you share, the closer the estimate will match the final cost.
